# doctorpricer-web

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

This will soon replace the ugly old Backbone.js version over at doctorpricer.co.nz. It offers a number of usability and performance improvements and looks much prettier.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
