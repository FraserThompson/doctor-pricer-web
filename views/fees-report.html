This because it takes a lot of time and energy.</p><p>I have 29 bespoke scrapers. Ideally I could just hit the button and grab the latest data, but PHOs often change their sites which means the scrapers break. This time, around half of the scrapers were broken and required fixing.</p><p>Going forward I will aim to shift to yearly updates.</p><h3>A note on data accuracy</h3><p>There are 1100 practices in the database and I am one person, obviously I have not individually validated the accuracy of every practice's data.</p><p>Further complicating things is the fact that sometimes there are multiple conflicting sources of data online, and sometimes the PHOs themselves are publishing incorrect data.</p><p>I am doing the best I can however, and have built a number of mechanisms for validating data. Despite this it's still possible that the fee you see here is not the same as the one you see at the practice. They should still be indicative relative to others though (since fees tend to shift around by similar amounts and a pricey practice will probably always be a pricey practice).</p><p>I am also not a statistician btw.</p></div>
