I have been the sole maintainer of DoctorPricer since I started it a decade ago.</p><p>During this period, I did my best to keep things up to date in my spare time, working independently of any government organisation and against a dysfunctional underfunded health system which positions primary care operators as competitors.</p><p>Unfortunately it's become increasingly clear that this is no longer tenable and the amount of work required to ensure fees are up to date is more than I can manage.</p><p><strong>Rather than mislead people with possibly incorrect information, I've decided to take it down.</strong></p><p>I hope it's been useful to people. I've never made money (the single ad barely covered hosting costs) but that's not what it was about. Not everything we do has to be in pursuit of profit and I implore anyone with skills and time to make something useful for the community.</p><p><strong>If you work at or around Te Whatu Ora and would like to support me by supplying regular up to date fee data, please let me know at <a href="mailto:doctorpricernz@gmail.com.">doctorpricernz@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p><p>It's a useful service and I'd love to bring it back.</p></div></div><loading-message></loading-message><style>.goodbye{max-width:640px}.goodbye p{font-size:18px}</style>
